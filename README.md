This folder holds the scripts and some data to build the NREL 118 Bus System. The scripts included are `118_sys.jl`, which will build the system with no time series data attached. `sys_DA.jl` builds the system, attaching the day ahead, time series data. `sys_RT.jl` builds the system attaching the real time, time series data.
